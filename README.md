# Soundslice test

Very simple test/demo of controlling a 
[soundlice](https://www.soundslice.com/help/player-api/)
embedded played from a MIDI input.

Open [public/index.html](public/index.html) in a browser
(Chrome), select a MIDI input and press 'start'.

Play a C3 note on that MIDI device.
If you don't have a physical MIDI controller then use a virtual 
or loopback MIDI devices and generate the MIDI note as follows:

Open [public/sendmidi.html](public/sendmidi.html) in a browser,
select the same MIDI loopback device and press 'start'.

Hopefully the embedded slice will start to play :-)
(just like the 'play' button)
